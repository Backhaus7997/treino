# Spec: coach-hub-web-foundation

**Change**: coach-hub-web-foundation
**Owner**: Track A (Shell & navigation)
**Date**: 2026-06-11
**Phase**: Fase W1 — Web foundation + detailed sidebar shell
**Artifact store**: openspec (file + Engram `sdd/coach-hub-web-foundation/spec`)
**Proposal ref**: `openspec/changes/coach-hub-web-foundation/proposal.md`
**Scenario range**: SCENARIO-748..SCENARIO-771

---

## Overview

This change introduces the web navigation shell for Coach Hub: a `ShellRoute`-backed `CoachHubScaffold` (sidebar + top bar + content area), a data-driven 19-item sidebar grouped into 6 sections, a persisted collapse state, responsive guards, and the migration of `CoachHubDashboardScreen` inside the shell with its `Scaffold` stripped. It also adds the `borderHover` palette token and ~12 `TreinoIcon` aliases required by the sidebar. After W1, every future web section plugs in via its own `sections/<section>/routes.dart` without touching `coach_hub_router.dart`.

---

## Requirements

---

### REQ-CHW-SHELL-001 — CoachHubScaffold Layout

`CoachHubScaffold` MUST render a three-region layout: sidebar (left), top bar (top-right), content area (remaining space). The content area MUST wrap its `child` in `ContentMaxWidth(1240)`. The outer container MUST use `AppPalette.of(context).bg` as background color.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-748, SCENARIO-749

---

### REQ-CHW-SHELL-002 — Dark Mode Only

`CoachHubScaffold` and all shell widgets MUST render exclusively in dark mode. No light-theme code branch MUST be introduced. All colors MUST use `AppPalette.of(context)` tokens. No hex literals are permitted.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-749

---

### REQ-CHW-SIDEBAR-001 — 19-Item Grouped Sidebar

`sidebar_registry.dart` MUST define exactly 19 `SidebarItem` entries organized into 6 labeled groups plus a bottom section:

| Group | Items |
|---|---|
| RESUMEN | Dashboard, Actividad, Agenda |
| ALUMNOS | Alumnos, Invitaciones, Cuestionario |
| PLAN | Rutinas, Planner semanal, Biblioteca, Templates |
| WELLNESS | Nutrición, Recetas, Suplementos, Hábitos |
| NEGOCIO | Pagos, Planes comerciales, Reportes |
| COMUNICACIÓN | Chat |
| Bottom | Ajustes |

Group labels and item names MUST be in es-AR Rioplatense. All sidebar strings MUST be tagged `// i18n: Fase W1`.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-750, SCENARIO-751

---

### REQ-CHW-SIDEBAR-002 — Navigation Behavior

The Dashboard sidebar item MUST navigate to its real screen. All other 18 items MUST navigate to the shared `ProximamenteScreen`, which renders the section label as a header plus the text `"Próximamente."` and carries a `// TODO(W2+): wire real screen` marker. (`/upload-plan` stays reachable as a legacy route inside the shell but is NOT a sidebar item.)

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-752, SCENARIO-753

---

### REQ-CHW-SIDEBAR-003 — Collapse / Expand

The sidebar MUST support two visual states: expanded (264 px) showing icons, group headers, and item labels; collapsed (72 px) showing icons only (group headers hidden). State toggle MUST be triggered by the top bar's sidebar toggle button. The collapsed-state width MUST be exactly 72 px and the expanded-state width MUST be exactly 264 px.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-754, SCENARIO-755

---

### REQ-CHW-SIDEBAR-004 — Collapse State Persisted

The sidebar collapsed/expanded state MUST be persisted to `localStorage` via `SharedPreferences` key `coach_hub.sidebar.collapsed`. On browser reload, the sidebar MUST restore the previously saved state. Default state (first visit, no key present) MUST be expanded.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-755, SCENARIO-756

---

### REQ-CHW-ROUTER-001 — ShellRoute Wraps Signed-in Routes

`coach_hub_router.dart` MUST wrap all signed-in routes inside a single `ShellRoute` whose `pageBuilder` renders `CoachHubScaffold`. The `ShellRoute.routes` list MUST be assembled by aggregating each section's `sections/<section>/routes.dart` exports.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-748, SCENARIO-757

---

### REQ-CHW-ROUTER-002 — Public Routes Outside Shell (Load-Bearing Invariant)

`/login` and `/not-allowed` MUST be declared as top-level `GoRoute`s, siblings of the `ShellRoute`, and MUST NOT appear as children inside `ShellRoute.routes`. A widget-pumped test MUST assert that pumping `/login` and `/not-allowed` does NOT find a `CoachHubScaffold` key in the widget tree.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-758, SCENARIO-759

---

### REQ-CHW-ROUTER-003 — Per-Section routes.dart Convention

Each section MUST own a `sections/<section>/routes.dart` file exporting its route list. Adding or modifying a section's routes MUST require no changes to `coach_hub_router.dart` beyond the one-time inclusion of the section's export in the aggregator list.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-757

---

### REQ-CHW-TOPBAR-001 — Top Bar Contents

The top bar MUST contain, left to right: sidebar toggle `IconButton`, breadcrumb widget (center), notifications bell `IconButton` (static, no badge), user menu widget (right). The top bar background MUST use `AppPalette.of(context).bg`.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-760

---

### REQ-CHW-TOPBAR-002 — Breadcrumb Derivation

The breadcrumb MUST read the current `GoRouterState.uri` and render the trail by matching path segments against `sidebarRegistry` item routes. The active item's label MUST appear as the last breadcrumb segment.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-761

---

### REQ-CHW-RESPONSIVE-001 — Compact Breakpoint Force-Collapse

At viewport widths between 768 px (inclusive) and 1280 px (exclusive), `CoachHubScaffold` MUST force the sidebar into the collapsed (72 px) state and MUST disable manual expand. At or above 1280 px the sidebar MAY be expanded or collapsed per user preference. (Below 768 px the `MobileBanner` replaces the shell entirely — see REQ-CHW-RESPONSIVE-002.)

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-762

---

### REQ-CHW-RESPONSIVE-002 — Mobile Banner

At viewport widths below 768 px, `CoachHubScaffold` MUST replace the entire layout with a full-screen banner reading `"Coach Hub no está optimizado para móvil — usá la app"`. The sidebar and top bar MUST NOT render at this width.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-763

---

### REQ-CHW-DASHBOARD-001 — Dashboard Inside Shell, Single Scaffold

After W1.4, `CoachHubDashboardScreen` MUST be located at `lib/features/coach_hub/presentation/sections/dashboard/coach_hub_dashboard_screen.dart`. It MUST NOT contain its own `Scaffold`. A widget test MUST assert exactly one `Scaffold` ancestor exists when the dashboard is pumped inside the shell.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-764, SCENARIO-765

---

### REQ-CHW-DASHBOARD-002 — Dashboard Content Unchanged

The dashboard content (pending requests list, filter chips, active alumnos list, paused/terminated sections, upload-plan CTA) MUST be functionally identical after the move. The brand header row (previously lines 119–165) MUST be removed. The `ConstrainedBox(maxWidth: 800)` MAY remain unchanged for W1.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-765

---

### REQ-CHW-UPLOADPLAN-001 — /upload-plan Route Preserved

`/upload-plan` and `/upload-plan/preview` routes MUST remain functional inside the shell after W1.2. Navigating to `/upload-plan` MUST render `CoachHubUploadPlanScreen` inside the shell (sidebar and top bar visible).

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-766

---

### REQ-CHW-PALETTE-001 — borderHover Token Added

`AppPalette` (all palette implementations) MUST include a `borderHover` color field. Its default value in `MintMagenta` MUST be `border` at a higher alpha. This addition MUST be purely additive — `copyWith` exhaustivity tests MUST remain green.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-767

---

### REQ-CHW-ICONS-001 — TreinoIcon Aliases for Sidebar

`TreinoIcon` MUST expose at least 12 new `const IconData` aliases covering the sidebar items that lack icons today (including but not limited to: Solicitudes, Invitaciones, Cuestionario, Rutinas, Templates, Planner semanal, Biblioteca, Nutrición, Recetas, Suplementos, Hábitos, Planes comerciales, Reportes, Ajustes). Each alias MUST map to a specific Phosphor variant. No sidebar widget MUST reference `PhosphorIcons.X` directly.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-768

---

### REQ-CHW-QA-001 — Existing Tests Stay Green

All 234+ existing tests MUST remain green after each etapa merges. No existing test file MUST be deleted or made to fail by W1 changes.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-769

---

### REQ-CHW-QA-002 — New Tests Required

W1 MUST add: (a) redirect scenarios for at least 4 new shell-wrapped routes in `coach_hub_router_redirect_test.dart`, (b) shell invariant test in `coach_hub_router_shell_test.dart` asserting public routes are outside the shell, (c) widget test for `CoachHubScaffold`, (d) unit test for `sidebarCollapsedProvider` persistence.

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-758, SCENARIO-759, SCENARIO-769, SCENARIO-770

---

### REQ-CHW-QA-003 — Build and Serve

`flutter build web -t lib/main_coach_hub.dart` MUST complete with 0 errors. `flutter analyze` MUST report 0 issues. `dart format .` MUST produce no diffs. The `coach-hub-dev` Firebase Hosting target MUST serve the shell successfully (manual smoke test per quality gate).

**Related SCENARIOs**: SCENARIO-771

## Change: coach-hub-biblioteca-web (Biblioteca Web Implementation)

**Merged from**: `openspec/changes/coach-hub-biblioteca-web/spec.md`
**Date merged**: 2026-07-02
**Status**: Fully implemented (PR #236, #237)

This change introduces the `/biblioteca` section for Coach Hub web (Fase W5.3), replacing the ProximamenteScreen placeholder with a read-only two-tab interface for browsing and filtering exercises (Ejercicios tab) and viewing trainer templates (Templates Rutinas tab). Delivered as two chained PRs: PR1 (filter extraction + Ejercicios tab) → PR2 (Templates tab + route wiring). All new files live under `coach_hub/presentation/sections/biblioteca/`. No backend, domain, or mobile changes.

---

### REQ-BIBW-01: Route replaces placeholder

The `/biblioteca` GoRoute MUST render `BibliotecaWebScreen` instead of `ProximamenteScreen`. The existing `bibliotecaSidebarItems` registration in `sidebar_registry.dart` MUST remain unchanged. The `badgeProvider` for the biblioteca sidebar item MUST remain `null`.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-01a: Sidebar navigation reaches real screen

- GIVEN the trainer is authenticated in Coach Hub web
- WHEN they click the "Biblioteca" sidebar item under group PLAN
- THEN the router navigates to `/biblioteca` and renders `BibliotecaWebScreen` (not `ProximamenteScreen`)

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-01b: Badge provider remains null

- GIVEN the sidebar registry is loaded
- WHEN `sidebar_registry_test` iterates all sidebar items asserting `badgeProvider isNull`
- THEN the biblioteca item passes (no badge provider added)

---

### REQ-BIBW-02: Section contract

`BibliotecaWebScreen` MUST be a `ConsumerStatefulWidget` with `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`. It MUST NOT declare its own `Scaffold` or `SafeArea` (the shell provides these per ADR-CHW-005). It MUST own a `TabController(length: 2)` for the two tabs. All dialogs MUST use `showDialog`/`AlertDialog`; `showModalBottomSheet` MUST NOT be used. All string literals MUST be hardcoded es-AR with a `// i18n` comment. All colors MUST come from `AppPalette.of(context)`. All icons MUST use `TreinoIcon`.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-02a: Screen renders without self Scaffold

- GIVEN `BibliotecaWebScreen` is mounted inside `CoachHubScaffold`
- WHEN the widget tree is inspected
- THEN no `Scaffold` or `SafeArea` widget is found as a descendant of `BibliotecaWebScreen` itself
- AND a `TabBar` with exactly 2 tabs is present ("Ejercicios", "Templates Rutinas")

---

### REQ-BIBW-03: Ejercicios tab — data merge

The Ejercicios tab MUST display a merged list of all catalog exercises (from `exercisesProvider`) and the trainer's custom exercises (from `customExercisesForTrainerStreamProvider`). Custom exercises MUST be visually distinguished with a "CUSTOM" badge. The merge MUST be performed at the presentation layer with no modification to either provider.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-03a: Custom exercise shows CUSTOM badge

- GIVEN the trainer has at least one custom exercise
- WHEN the Ejercicios tab is displayed with no active filters
- THEN each custom exercise card carries a "CUSTOM" badge
- AND catalog exercises carry no such badge

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-03b: Empty catalog state

- GIVEN both providers return empty lists
- WHEN the Ejercicios tab renders
- THEN an empty-state widget is shown (no grid, no error)

---

### REQ-BIBW-04: Ejercicios tab — exercise card

Each exercise card MUST display: a thumbnail (`assets/exercises/{id}.png`) with icon fallback if asset missing; exercise name; "Músculo · Categoría" subtitle; equipment label; rest-seconds badge. Cards MUST be arranged in a responsive grid.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-04a: Card renders with fallback icon

- GIVEN an exercise whose PNG asset does not exist
- WHEN its card is rendered
- THEN the thumbnail shows a fallback icon (no broken image)
- AND name, muscle, category, equipment, and rest badge are all visible

---

### REQ-BIBW-05: Ejercicios tab — search

The Ejercicios tab MUST provide a search bar. Search MUST be diacritic-tolerant (using extracted `foldSearch`). The grid MUST update in real time. Search matches on exercise name and aliases.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-05a: Search narrows the grid

- GIVEN at least 3 exercises are visible
- WHEN the trainer types "bicep"
- THEN only exercises whose name/alias diacritic-fold matches "bicep" remain visible

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-05b: Diacritic tolerance

- GIVEN an exercise named "Remo con Mancuerna"
- WHEN the trainer types "mancuerna" (no accent)
- THEN that card remains visible

---

### REQ-BIBW-06: Ejercicios tab — inline filter chips

Filter chips for muscle groups and equipment MUST be inline. MUST NOT open any bottom sheet. Multiple chips within a dimension = OR. Chips across dimensions = AND. Active filter state held in web-only StateProviders.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-06a: Muscle filter chip narrows the grid

- GIVEN chips for "PECHO" and "ESPALDA" are available
- WHEN the trainer taps "PECHO"
- THEN only exercises with Pecho as primary or secondary muscle remain visible
- AND no bottom sheet appears

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-06b: Equipment filter excludes null-equipment exercises (ADR-RER-05)

- GIVEN no equipment chips are active
- WHEN the trainer activates "MANCUERNA"
- THEN exercises with `equipment == null` are removed from the grid

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-06c: Combined search + filter (AND across dimensions)

- GIVEN muscle chip "ESPALDA" is active AND search bar contains "remo"
- WHEN the grid updates
- THEN only exercises that match BOTH "remo" text AND Espalda muscle are shown

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-06d: Multiple chips in one dimension (OR within dimension)

- GIVEN "PECHO" and "HOMBROS" are both active
- WHEN the grid renders
- THEN exercises for Pecho OR Hombros are shown

---

### REQ-BIBW-07: Ejercicios tab — exercise detail dialog

Tapping an exercise card MUST open an `AlertDialog` containing technique instructions and video/gif if available. MUST NOT use bottom sheet. Dialog MUST be dismissible.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-07a: Tapping card opens detail dialog with technique

- GIVEN an exercise card is visible
- WHEN the trainer taps it
- THEN an `AlertDialog` appears with technique instructions
- AND no bottom sheet is shown

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-07b: Dialog without video

- GIVEN an exercise has no `videoUrl`
- WHEN the detail dialog opens
- THEN the video section is absent or placeholder; no crash occurs

---

### REQ-BIBW-08: Filter predicate extraction

`foldSearch` and `_matches` logic MUST be extracted into a shared pure function `exerciseMatchesFilters(Exercise e, {required String query, required Set<MuscleGroup> muscles, required Set<EquipmentType> equipment})`. Mobile picker's `_matches` MUST delegate to it. ADR-RER-05 (exclude null-equipment when any equipment filter active) and primary-OR-secondary muscle rule MUST be preserved verbatim.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-08a: Extracted predicate matches mobile behavior

- GIVEN the same exercise list and filter state
- WHEN `exerciseMatchesFilters` is called
- THEN results are identical to the previous inlined behavior (mobile picker tests remain green)

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-08b: ADR-RER-05 preserved in extraction

- GIVEN an exercise with `equipment == null`
- WHEN `exerciseMatchesFilters` is called with a non-empty equipment set
- THEN the function returns `false` for that exercise

---

### REQ-BIBW-09: Templates Rutinas tab — grid

Templates tab MUST display a responsive grid from `trainerTemplatesStreamProvider`. Each card MUST show: name; "N días/sem · N semanas"; level. MUST NOT show "N alumnos" count.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-09a: Templates grid renders from provider

- GIVEN `trainerTemplatesStreamProvider` returns 3 templates
- WHEN the Templates tab displays
- THEN 3 cards are rendered with name, días/sem·semanas, and level

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-09b: Card omits alumnos count

- GIVEN a template card is rendered
- WHEN its widget tree is inspected
- THEN no text matching "alumnos" or athlete-count pattern is found

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-09c: Empty templates state

- GIVEN `trainerTemplatesStreamProvider` returns empty list
- WHEN the tab renders
- THEN an empty-state widget is shown

---

### REQ-BIBW-10: Templates Rutinas tab — template read view

Tapping a template card MUST open a read-only view. Template editing MUST NOT be accessible from this screen.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-10a: Tapping template card opens read view

- GIVEN a template card is visible
- WHEN the trainer taps it
- THEN a read-only view of the template is shown with no edit controls

---

### REQ-BIBW-11: Loading and error states

Both tabs MUST handle loading states with a loading indicator and error states with an error message. No crash on either state.

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-11a: Loading state shown during data fetch

- GIVEN `exercisesProvider` is loading
- WHEN the Ejercicios tab renders
- THEN a loading indicator is visible (no grid, no crash)

#### SCENARIO-BIBW-11b: Error state shown on provider failure

- GIVEN `trainerTemplatesStreamProvider` emits an error
- WHEN the Templates tab renders
- THEN an error message is displayed (no crash)

---

### Cross-cutting constraints (coach-hub-biblioteca-web)

| # | Constraint |
|---|-----------|
| C-BIBW-1 | All files MUST be under `coach_hub/presentation/sections/biblioteca/` |
| C-BIBW-2 | NO `Scaffold` — `CoachHubScaffold` provides the shell (ADR-CHW-005) |
| C-BIBW-3 | Use `AppPalette.of(context)` — MUST NOT hardcode hex colors |
| C-BIBW-4 | Use `TreinoIcon.X` — MUST NOT use Phosphor or other icon packs |

| C-BIBW-9 | `dart analyze` must return 0 errors; `dart format` applied; all tests green before merge |
| C-BIBW-10 | Each PR MUST be independently shippable (PR1 extraction+Ejercicios; PR2 Templates+routes) |

---

### Out of Scope (coach-hub-biblioteca-web)

- Custom exercise CRUD on web (follow-up; CustomExerciseRepository CRUD exists)
- Template assign-to-athlete (W5.4)
- Alimentos + Templates Nutrición tabs (W7 nutrition domain; NOT built)
- Routine template editing (W5.2 routine editor)
- "N alumnos" template count (not denormalized on Routine)
- Live catalog sync (exercisesProvider is one-time FutureProvider; acceptable)

---

## Out of Scope (Explicit)

- **Badge wiring** — `badgeProvider` infrastructure is NOT added in W1. Solicitudes badge deferred to W2; Chat badge to W5; Pagos badge to W4; Agenda badge to W4.
- **Actividad data source** — the `Actividad` sidebar item exists and routes to a placeholder; the data model (Firestore collection vs CF aggregation) is a dedicated Fase W2 proposal.
- **Production domain** — `coach-hub-prod` Hosting target and domain choice deferred until user confirms domain (e.g., `coach.treino.app`).
- **Perfil Público location** — deferred to Fase W6 (Ajustes tab is the working assumption; confirmed in W6 proposal).
- **Real navigation for non-shipped sections** — all 19 non-Dashboard, non-ImportarExcel items route to `_PlaceholderScreen` until their respective fases land.
- **Dashboard content redesign** — W4.1 per mockup. The existing layout and `ConstrainedBox(maxWidth: 800)` are left untouched.
- **Notification drawer** — bell renders as static `IconButton`; drawer is Fase W3 at earliest.
- **Mobile code** — `lib/app/router.dart` and all mobile screens are untouched.

---

## Hard Constraints

1. `pubspec.yaml` MUST NOT be modified. `shared_preferences ^2.3.0` and `web ^1.1.0` are already present.
2. `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json` MUST NOT be modified.
3. All colors in client Dart MUST use `AppPalette.of(context)`. No hex literals.
4. All icons MUST use `TreinoIcon.X`. No direct `PhosphorIcons.X` references.
5. All user-facing UI strings in es-AR Rioplatense with `// i18n: Fase W1` markers.
6. Dark mode only — no light theme code.
7. Each PR diff MUST be ≤ 400 LOC (W1.1 ~400, W1.2 ~250, W1.3 ~300, W1.4 ~150).
8. Conventional commits only. NO `Co-Authored-By`. NO AI attribution.

## Change: coach-hub-pagos-web (Pagos Web Implementation)

**Merged from**: `openspec/changes/coach-hub-pagos-web/spec.md`
**Date merged**: 2026-07-01
**Status**: Fully implemented (PR #224, #226, #231)

This change introduces the `/pagos` section screen for trainer-wide payment tracking, replacing the ProximamenteScreen placeholder. Delivered as three chained PRs: PR1 (Widget extraction) → PR2a (Screen shell + data) → PR2b (Rich table + row actions). All new files live under `coach_hub/presentation/sections/pagos/`. No backend, domain, or mobile changes.

---

### REQ-PAGW-ROUTE-001 — `/pagos` route renders `PagosWebScreen`, not `ProximamenteScreen`

`sections/pagos/routes.dart` MUST register `PagosWebScreen` as the widget for the `/pagos` route. `ProximamenteScreen` MUST NOT appear in the pagos route definition after this change.

**Related Scenarios**: 
- GIVEN the router is built WHEN the `/pagos` route is resolved THEN the widget tree contains `PagosWebScreen` and no `ProximamenteScreen`.
- GIVEN a trainer navigates via the sidebar Pagos item WHEN the route resolves THEN `PagosWebScreen` is rendered (no placeholder).

---

### REQ-PAGW-SHELL-001 — `PagosWebScreen` honors the section contract (no Scaffold, no SafeArea)

`PagosWebScreen` MUST be a `ConsumerStatefulWidget`. It MUST NOT introduce `Scaffold`, `SafeArea`, or `AppBackground` anywhere in its subtree. The shell provides those layers (ADR-CHW-005). It MUST use `AppPalette.of(context)` for all colors. No HEX literal color constants in any new file under `sections/pagos/`.

---

### REQ-PAGW-SHELL-002 — Section header and "Registrar pago" action

`PagosWebScreen` MUST render a section header with text `"PAGOS"` and a primary action button labeled `"+ Registrar pago"`. Tapping `"+ Registrar pago"` MUST open the `RegistrarPagoDialog` via `showDialog`/`AlertDialog`. No bottom sheets.

---

### REQ-PAGW-KPI-001 — KPI row shows Ingreso del mes, Pendiente cobrar, Vencido

The screen MUST render a KPI row containing exactly three tiles: **"Ingreso del mes"** (sum of `amountArs` for `status==paid` payments in the current calendar month), **"Pendiente cobrar"** (sum of `amountArs` for Por vencer payments from `pagosPorCobrarProvider`), and **"Vencido"** (sum of `amountArs` for Vencidos payments). Values MUST be formatted as `$X.XXX` (es-AR, no decimals). All derivations are client-side; no new Firestore query or Cloud Function.

---

### REQ-PAGW-TAB-001 — 4 tabs with mutually exclusive grouping

The screen MUST render exactly 4 tabs: **Vencidos**, **Por vencer**, **Pagados**, **Todos**. A `Payment` MUST belong to exactly one of the first three groups — no overlap between Vencidos and Por vencer.

| Tab | Filter rule |
|-----|-------------|
| Vencidos | `status == pending` AND `createdAt < currentPeriodStart` |
| Por vencer | `pagosPorCobrarProvider` current-period pending (status == pending AND createdAt >= currentPeriodStart) |
| Pagados | `status == paid` |
| Todos | all payments |

---

### REQ-PAGW-TAB-002 — Tab badge shows payment count

Each tab label MUST display the count of payments belonging to that group as a badge or parenthetical (e.g. `"Vencidos · 3"`). Count updates reactively as the provider stream changes.

---

### REQ-PAGW-TABLE-001 — Payments table columns

Each active tab MUST render a `PagosTable` widget with exactly 6 columns: **Alumno** (athlete display name), **Concepto/Plan** (payment `concept`), **Monto** (`amountArs` formatted es-AR), **Vencimiento** (formatted date), **Estado** (chip: `"Pagado"` / `"Pendiente"` / `"Vencido"`), **Acciones** (row action buttons).

---

### REQ-PAGW-ACTION-001 — "Marcar pagado" persists via repository and updates UI reactively

Each row with `status == pending` MUST show a `"Marcar pagado"` action button. Tapping it MUST open an `AlertDialog` for confirmation. On confirm, it MUST call `paymentRepository.markManyPaid` for that payment. On success, the payment's `status` becomes `paid` and the row moves from Por vencer/Vencidos to Pagados reactively via the provider stream. `showDialog`/`AlertDialog` only — no bottom sheets.

---

### REQ-PAGW-ACTION-002 — "Recordar" sends a payment reminder via the in-app chat

Each payment row MUST show a `"Recordar"` action button. Tapping it MUST open a confirmation dialog pre-filled with an editable reminder message; on confirm it MUST send that message to the athlete through the existing in-app chat (`chatForOtherUidProvider` resolves/creates the trainer↔athlete `Chat`, then `ChatRepository.sendMessage`). The message MUST include: the payment `amountArs` (formatted es-AR), the payment `concept`, and the trainer's `paymentAlias` (from `UserProfile`) when present. The `notifyOnChatMessage` Cloud Function delivers the push to the athlete. No athlete phone number is required or stored. (Supersedes the earlier WhatsApp `wa.me` approach — the in-app chat needs no phone and keeps the trainer inside the app.)

---

### REQ-PAGW-REGISTRAR-001 — "Registrar pago" dialog adds a payment via repository

`RegistrarPagoDialog` (extracted from `alumno_detail_screen.dart`) MUST collect `amount` (int, ARS) and `concept` (String). On confirm, it MUST call `paymentRepository.add(...)` with the provided values and the current trainer ID. The new payment appears in the appropriate tab reactively via `trainerPaymentsProvider`. On cancel, no write occurs.

---

### REQ-PAGW-EMPTY-001 — Empty state per tab

When a tab has zero payments, a non-crashing, informative empty-state widget MUST be displayed. The empty-state text MUST be tab-specific (e.g., `"No hay pagos vencidos"`, `"No hay pagos pendientes"`, `"No hay pagos registrados"`, `"No hay pagos"` for Todos).

---

### REQ-PAGW-ROLE-001 — Non-trainer roles do not access `/pagos`

The `/pagos` route MUST remain gated to the `trainer` role. Athletes navigating to `/pagos` MUST receive the same not-allowed treatment as the existing role gate (no change to existing gate logic — this requirement documents the invariant).

---

### REQ-PAGW-EXTRACT-001 — Widget extraction from `alumno_detail_screen.dart` is behavior-preserving (PR1)

The widgets and helpers extracted from `alumno_detail_screen.dart` (`RegistrarPagoDialog`, `EstadoCuentaCard`, `PagosTable`, `_marcarPagado`, `_registrarPago`, `_fmtArs`, `nextDueDate`, `fmtDayMonth`) to `sections/pagos/widgets/` MUST NOT change the behavior of `alumno_detail_screen.dart`. After extraction, `alumno_detail_screen.dart` MUST re-import them; all existing tests and `flutter analyze` MUST pass unchanged.

---

### Cross-cutting constraints (coach-hub-pagos-web)

| # | Constraint |
|---|-----------|
| C-PAGW-1 | All files MUST be under `coach_hub/presentation/sections/pagos/` |
| C-PAGW-2 | NO `Scaffold` — `CoachHubScaffold` provides the shell (ADR-CHW-005) |
| C-PAGW-3 | Use `AppPalette.of(context)` — MUST NOT hardcode hex colors |
| C-PAGW-4 | Use `TreinoIcon.X` — MUST NOT use Phosphor or other icon packs |
| C-PAGW-5 | Widgets MUST be `ConsumerStatefulWidget`; page-local state `autoDispose+family` |
| C-PAGW-6 | Strings hardcoded Spanish + `// i18n`; MUST NOT call `AppL10n` |
| C-PAGW-7 | Dialogs MUST use `showDialog` / `AlertDialog`; MUST NOT use `showModalBottomSheet` |
| C-PAGW-8 | MUST NOT modify mobile files; payment-handling on mobile remains unchanged |
| C-PAGW-9 | `dart analyze` must return 0 errors; `dart format` applied; all tests green before merge |
| C-PAGW-10 | Each PR MUST be independently shippable (PR1 extraction; PR2a screen+data; PR2b table+actions) |

---

### Out of Scope (coach-hub-pagos-web)

- Mercado Pago or any payment gateway integration
- Storing athlete phone number
- Auto-detecting uncharged recurring periods (requires Cloud Function — V2)
- Month selector for payment history (V2)
- CSV export (V2)
- `Proyectado mes` KPI (V2, non-trivial client-side derivation)
- Real `dueDate` field (uses `createdAt` as proxy; full recurring billing deferred)
